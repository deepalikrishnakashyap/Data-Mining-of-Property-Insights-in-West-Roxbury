# Data-Mining-of-Property-Insights-in-West-Roxbury
Analyzed property features to determine market price influencers, evaluating predictive models(Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR), using PCA, MSE and R-squared. 

# Overview

This repository contains the analysis and implementation of a linear regression model using Python to explore real estate data from the West Roxbury dataset. The project aims to derive meaningful insights and predictive capabilities from housing data.

# Background

Real estate pricing is influenced by various factors such as location, lot size, building condition, and number of rooms. This project applies linear regression techniques to analyze these factors and determine their impact on housing prices in West Roxbury. By leveraging data mining techniques, the project explores correlations, assesses model accuracy, and identifies key predictors affecting property values.
